                        <h3>Chandra</h3>
                        <p>The Chandra X-ray Observatory is part of NASA's fleet of "Great Observatories Project", or abbreviated "GOP".</p>
                        <p>Chandra allows scientists from around the world to obtain X-ray images of exotic environments to help understand the structure and evolution of the universe. The Chandra X-ray Observatory program is managed by NASA's Marshall Center for the Science Mission Directorate. </p>
                        <p>The Chandra scans space in X-Rays and discovers much more than all our satellites could do. X-Ray can see cosmic radiation and thus quicken the search on new stars.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html">The CXC Web site</a> is the primary resource for information on the Chanda X-ray Observatory mission.</p>

                        <h3>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</h3>
                        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.</p>
                        <p>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., in Washington, D.C.</p>
                        <p>The HST is considered the Telescope with the strongest ocular lens in space.</p>
                        <p>The Hubble Space Telescope is part of <a href="../projects.html?object=0"> the GOP project </a></p>

                        <h3>Compton</h3>
                        <p>Compton, or in its full name, The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) detected light from over billions of miles across the universe. It featured four main telescopes in one spacecraft to achieve it's purpose.</p>
                        <p>Costing over 617 Million dollars and weighing over 17 Tons, this is the most heavy and costly astrophysical payload ever floan at that time.</p>
                        <p>Compton was launched at 5 Aptril 1991, but already deorbited at 5 June 2000 due to a technical malfunction.</p>
                        <p>The craft was part of the 4 GOP spacecrafts. The craft will not be replaced.</p>

                        <h3>Spitzer</h3>
                        <p>The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility) was launched into space by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. Consisting of a 0.85-meter telescope and three cryogenically-cooled science instruments, Spitzer was the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space at the time</p>
                        <p>Spitzer is the final mission in NASA's Great Observatories Program - a family of four orbiting observatories, each observing the Universe in a different kind of light (visible, gamma rays, X-rays, and infrared). <br/>
                            Spitzer is also a part of NASA's Astronomical Search for Origins Program, designed to provide information which will help us understand our cosmic roots, and how galaxies, stars and planets develop and form.</p>

                        <p>The International Space Station is a collaboration of 15 nations working together to create a crewed, state-of-the-art orbiting research facility. The space station also serves as a platform for Earth science instruments, including ISS-RapidScat and the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS).</p>
                        <p>This is the operation base for many space walks, sattelite reperation missions and testing on human reactions of long-term weightlessness.</p>

                        <p>STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) is the third mission in NASA's Solar Terrestrial Probes program (STP). It employs two nearly identical space-based observatories - one ahead of Earth in its orbit, the other trailing behind - to provide the first-ever stereoscopic measurements to study the Sun and the nature of its coronal mass ejections, or CMEs.</p>

                        <h3>Mars Odyssey</h3>
                        <p>The name "2001 Mars Odyssey" was selected as a tribute to the vision and spirit of space exploration as embodied in the works of renowned science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke. The name speaks to our hopes for the future and of the fundamental human desire to explore the unknown despite great dangers, the risk of failure and the daunting, enormous depths of space.</p>
                        <p>For the first time, the mission globally mapped the amount and distribution of many chemical elements and minerals that make up the martian surface. Maps of hydrogen distribution led scientists to discover vast amounts of water ice in the polar regions burried just beneath the surface. Odyssey also recorded the radiation environment in low <a href="../galaxy.html?object=4">Mars</a> orbit to determine the radiation-related risk to any future human explorers who may one day go to <a href="../galaxy.html?object=4">Mars</a>.</p>
                        <p>Launch Date: 7 April 2001</p>

                        <p>The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission science objective is to discover the nature of the interactions between the solar wind and the interstellar medium at the edge of our solar system.</p>

                        <h3>NuSTAR</h3>
                        <p>The NuSTAR mission has deployed the first orbiting telescopes to focus light in the high energy X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our view of the universe in this spectral window has been limited because previous orbiting telescopes have not employed true focusing optics, but rather have used coded apertures that have intrinsically high backgrounds and limited sensitivity.</p>
                        <p>In addition to its core science program, NuSTAR will offer opportunities for a broad range of science investigations, ranging from probing cosmic ray origins to studying the extreme physics around collapsed stars to mapping microflares on the surface of <a href="../galaxy.html?object=0">the Sun</a>. NuSTAR will also respond to targets of opportunity including supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.</p>
                        <p>Launch Date: 13 June 2012</p>

                        <h3>WISE</h3>
                        <p>The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, will scan the entire sky in infrared light, picking up the glow of hundreds of millions of objects and producing millions of images.</p>
                        <p>The mission will uncover objects never seen before, including the coolest stars, the universe's most luminous galaxies and some of the darkest near-Earth asteroids and comets. Its vast catalogs will help answer fundamental questions about the origins of planets, stars and galaxies, and provide a feast of data for astronomers to munch on for decades to come.</p>
                        <p>Launch Date: 14 December 2009</p>

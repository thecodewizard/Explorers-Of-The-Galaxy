                        <h3>The Sun</h3>
                        <p>Our solar system's central star, the sun, has been our object of interest ever since we've started exploring space. <br/>
                        This star, a yellow dwarf, is studied by <a href="projects.html?object=3">the STEREO mission</a>, which mainly focusses on the sun's magnetic field, radiation and ultraviolet waves.</p>
                        <p>The sun mainly consists of Hydrogen and Helium, which are in continous ignition. The photosphere's temparature is calculated to be approximately about 5780K (5566 °C)</p>
                        <p>The sun is the closest star to Earth, at a mean distance from our planet of 149.60 million kilometers. This distance is know as an astronomical unit. (Abbriviated AU)
                        The AU sets the scale for measuring distances all across the solar system.</p>
                        <p>Guessed by the yellow dwarf stage, the sun must be 4.59 billion years old.</p>

                        <h3>Mercury</h3>
                        <p>Mercury's eccentric orbit takes the small planet as close as 47 million kilometers and as far as 70 million kilometers from the sun. If one could stand on the scorching surface of Mercury when it's as its closest point to the sun, that person would be exposed to temperatures of 427°C at day and -173°C at night. The sun would appear four times as big to him.</p>
                        <p>The orbit of Mercury takes 88 days and the planet has no natural satelites. Because of the lack of Atmosphere, it has an extreme climate change and is victim for many small meteorites.</p>
                        <p>The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was Mariner 10, which imaged about 45 percent of the surface. NASA's MESSENGER mission flew by Mercury three times in 2008-2009 and has been in orbit around the planet since 18 March 2011. Almost the entire planet has now been imaged, revealing a surface that has been shaped both by extensive volcanism and small impacts.</p>

                        <h3>Venus</h3>
                        <p>Venus and Earth are similar in size, mass, density, composition and gravity. There, however, the similarities end. Venus is covered by a thick, rapidly spinning atmosphere, creating a scorched world with tempeartues hot enough to melt lead and surface pressure 90 times that of Earth.<br/>
                        Because of its proximity to Earth and the way its clouds reflect sunlight, Venus appears to be the brightest planet in the Sky.</p>
                        <p>The planet makes the trip around the sun in 224.7 days and is by far the worst host for life. With clouds existing of Sulfuric Acid and an atmosphere consisting 96% out of Carbon Dioxide, it's impossible to land any craft on its surface and make it working for more than a day.</p>
                        <p>We cannot normally see through the thick atmosphere, but NASA's Magellan mission early 1990 used radar to image 98% of the surface. The Galileo spacecraft bypassed Venus and scanned its surface using infrared.</p>

                        <h3>Earth</h3>
                        <p>Earth, our home planet, is the only planet in our solar system known to harbor life. The planet's life approximately developed itself about 3.5 billion years ago and is characterised by Mass Extinctions. <br/>
                        The life on earth is made possible by its ozone layer. The geomagnetic field blocked the most of life-threatening parts of the Sun's radiation.</p>
                        <p>The planet consists 71% out of water and has a 365.25 day orbit, making the planet move around the sun at about 29.8 kilometers per second.</p>
                        <p>The atmosphere consists for 78% out of Nitrogen, 21% out of Oxigen and 1% other ingredients. It consists of 6 stages before going over to space at a 50.000 kilometer height.</p>

                        <p>Mars is a rocky body aobut half the size of Earth, making it the smalles planet in the solar system after Mercury. <br/>
                        Even though the smallest, it has the highest mountain known of the solar system, Olympus Mons, reaching into the planets atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>The Planet has two moons, Phobos and Deimos and is host to Two Robotic Rovers, 'opportunity' and 'Curiosity'. There are 5 functional spacecrafts orbitting the planet. The most valuable craft until now, the <a href="spacecrafts/orbitational_crafts.html?object=6"> 2001 Mars' Odyssee </a> (a joking reference to Kubrik's movie, 2001 A space Odyssee and the writer of the book, Arthur C. Clarcke), has been the thriving power after the planned manned mars mission.</p>
                        <p>Mars has a 687 day orbit and is known to have, analog to Earth, iced Polar caps.</p>

                        <h3>Jupiter</h3>
                        <p>Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in our solar system, containing more than twice the amount of material of the other bodies orbiting our sun combined.<br/>
                        The planet consists mainly of Hydrogen with a quarter of it's mass being Helium making the planet a Gas Giant.</p>
                        <p>Jupiter is extensively studied by various space organisations. It had flybys from the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=4">pioneer 10</a>, the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=5">pioneer 11 </a>, the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=6"> voyager crafts</a>, the galileo Orbiter and the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=3">New Horizon</a> craft.</p>
                        <p>The planet has 67 moons. One of NASA's upcoming missions will explore the ice covered Moon called Europa to examine the age of the planet and its orbitters.</p>
                        <p>A special fact about Jupiter is that the planet, being a Gas Giant, has no solid surface. So you could fly right into Jupiter and come out of the planet unharmed at the other side.</p>

                        <h3>Saturn</h3>
                        <p>Saturn is the second largest in the solar system, after Jupiter. Just as its large brother, Saturn is a Gas Giant. <br/>
                        It's core consists of Iron-nickel and rock surrounded by Liquid Hydrogen and Helium. Its yellow color is due to ammoniac crystals. Flying trough Saturn, altough a Gas Giant, would have disatrous consequences.</p>
                        <p>The most characterizing fact about Saturn, is its rings. Saturn is host to 9 man rings and 3 side arcs. These are composed from rocky debris and dust.</p>
                        <p>The planet had flybys from the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=6">voyager crafts</a> and is orbitted by a couple of moons. <br/>
                        It's second-biggest moon, named Titan, is bigger than Mercury.</p>
                        <p>Saturns orbit takes 29 earth Years.</p>

                        <h3>Uranus</h3>
                        <p>Uranus, similar in composition to neptune, is known as an Ice Giant.<br/> Its core exists of Hydrogen and Helium with Iced Water, ammoniac and methane.</p>
                        <p>Due to it's distance to the sun, the minimum temperature of the planet is -224,1°C, which is the planet closest to the absolute minimum of 0K or -271.14°C.</p>
                        <p>LIke Venus, Uranus rotates east to West. Uranus' roation axis is tilted almost parallel to its orbital plane, so Uranus appears to be rotation on its side. This situation may be the result of a collision wit ha planet-sized boy early in the planet's history, which apparenly radically changed Uranus' rotation. Because of this, the planet suffers from extreme variantions in sunlight during each 20-year-long season.</p>
                        <p>The winds on Uranus can reach to 250m/s. Although unvisible for the human eye, Uranus is host to a small ring system and numerous moons.</p>

                        <h3>Neptune</h3>
                        <p>The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical prediction rathen than through regular observations of the sky. When Uranus didn't travel exactly as astronomers expected it to, the suspicion of an other close-by planet rose.</p>
                        <p>Neptune is the most dense of the planet of the ice Giants, consiting of frozen ammoniac and a mathane Core. It has, similar with the Red Spot on Jupiter, a great dark spot. This spot, as well as the spot on Jupiter, is in fact an ever raging storm with winds up to 2100km/h within the storm.</p>
                        <p>14 moons are orbiting Neptune and the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=6">voyager 10</a> used this planet in order to accelerate and being catapulted into interstelaar space.</p>
                        <p>It's orbit takes no less than 248 earth years. Who would live on Neptune, would be rather upset by the lack of Summer Vacation for 247 years.</p>

                        <h3>Cuiper Belt</h3>
                        <p>The Cuiper Belt is nothing more than the region beyond the planets, at approximately 50 AU from <a href="galaxy.html?object=0">the sun.</a></p>
                        <p>The Cuiper Belt exists of many asteroids in a ring formation. It has three officially recognized dwarf planets. Pluto, Haumea and MakeMake. <br/>
                        The objects in this belt are the most distant orbitting objects around the sun.<br/>
                        Neptunes moon Triton and Saturns moon Phoebe are believed to be originated from this region.</p>
                        <p>Pluto is the largest member of the Kuiper Belt.<br/>
                        Pluto will have a visitor on the 14th of July 2015 when the <a href="spacecrafts/interstellar_probes.html?object=3">New Horizons</a> spacecraft will flyby Pluto before continuing it's trip into interstellar space!</p>

                        <h3>The Milkey Way</h3>
                        <p>The Milkey Way is, simply formed, the galaxy that contains our solar system.<br/>
                        It is 100.000 Lightyears width and it contains 100-400 billion stars. The miley way must be formed shortly after the big bang.</p>
                        <p>at this level, we can divide the galaxy up in architectural pieces. The Milkey Way is part of what we call the 'local group'. This group are all the closeby group of solar systems combined. <br/>
                        All these are part of the local supercluster, named the Virgo Supercluster. Every closeby Supercluster next to the Virgo Supercluster is part of the last division, the Laniakea Supercluster.<br/>
                        All neighbours and equals of the Laniakea make up the totality of theoratically calculated space. See next topic, Supercluster Theorem for the theoretical 'end' of space.</p>
                        <p>The milkey way is visible from places close to the polar caps that are not light polluted. You can watch them in Chili, Norwege, ...</p>

                        <h3>The Supercluster Theorem</h3>
                        <p>The supercluster theorem consists of theoretical and mathematical calculated possiblities of the "end of space". Worlds most reknowed scientist Stephen Hawking has made a lot of influence on this theorem. <br/>
                        The space is considered endless up to a certain point.</p>
                        <p>The last acknowledged theorem is a vision of space as if it was a huge elastic surface. First, all matter was compressed in a very dense, compact space, until the critical point was reached and all matter exploded and flew all across the space. This is known as the Big Bang Theory. However, as every object has it's magnetical force, the outward movement will halt and the objects in space will pull theirselves back onto each other again until they are compressed into the same dense space as before.</p>
                        <p>Another widely acknowledged theorem is the Donut-Shape theorem. The space would consist out of a donut shape. The objects on the shape do attact each other, but they will continue to float as they move in a circular environment.<br/>
                        Future will tell which of the Theorems is correct.</p>

                        <h3>Supercluster Void</h3>
                        <p>The Supercluster Void is an addition to the Supercluster Theorem. It recently developed under the study of MIT and the influence of Stephen Hawking.</p>
                        <p>Considering the law in physics that dictates that mass cannot be at the same place on the same time, scientists are analysing the probablility of extending that law to the phrase "all matter must have an unique space at a given time in such a way that all space will be contained with the matter</p>
                        <p>The best example is given with a gas. If you release 1cm² gas in a 1m² balloon, the gas will expand and will take up the whole 1m² balloon.</p>
                        <p>Now, for this law to be correct, the so called 'black matter' in space ought to take up space as well. But as there is no attraction, no photon collision and no density for this matter
                        scientist are in debate whether or not there is such a thing as 'black matter.'<br/>
                        Ever again, the future must hold the solution to this problem.</p>
